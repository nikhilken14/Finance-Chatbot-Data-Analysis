    "\n",
    "        This financial chatbot prototype responds to a set of predefined queries about the financial performance of three companies: Apple, Tesla, and Microsoft. It uses simple keyword matching to identify the company and the financial metric requested by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Predefined Queries Supported:\n",
    "        Total revenue for the latest fiscal year (2024)\n",
    "        Net income change from 2023 to 2024\n",
    "        Cash flow from operating activities for 2024\n",
    "        \n",
    "        The chatbot extracts the relevant data from stored financial figures and provides formatted responses with clear, easy-to-understand information.\n",

    "    Limitations:\n",
    "        The chatbot only understands specific keywords and predefined query formats.\n",
    "        It cannot handle complex or conversational language variations.\n",
    "        It only supports the three companies included and the three financial metrics listed above.\n",
    "        Responses are static based on stored data and do not update in real-time."
