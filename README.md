## Overview 
  This project is a simple financial chatbot prototype designed to provide quick, predefined responses to common financial questions about three major companies: Apple, Tesla, and Microsoft. 
  The chatbot uses Python and basic logic to match user queries to stored financial data and deliver relevant answers in a conversational manner.
  
  It demonstrates fundamental chatbot development concepts including:
    Handling predefined queries with if-else logic
    Storing and accessing financial data for multiple companies
    Providing meaningful, formatted responses based on data analysis

## Features
  Supports queries about:
    Total revenue for the latest fiscal year (2024)
    Net income change from 2023 to 2024
    Cash flow from operating activities for 2024
    Recognizes company names: Apple, Tesla, Microsoft
    Simple command-line interface for interaction
    User can type exit to end the session


## Financial Data and Analysis
  The chatbot uses historical financial data from the years 2022 to 2024 for Apple, Tesla, and Microsoft, including revenue, net income, and cash flow figures.
  Key insights used in the chatbot responses:
  
      Total Revenue: The chatbot reports the total revenue for 2024, showing the companiesâ€™ scale of operations in the most recent year.
      
      Net Income Change: It calculates and reports the change in net income from 2023 to 2024 to indicate profit trends.
      
      Cash Flow: It provides the cash flow from operating activities for 2024, reflecting the liquidity position of each company.
      
      The data-driven approach ensures that the chatbot provides accurate, contextual financial information based on real company performance metrics.

  Type your financial questions related to Apple, Tesla, or Microsoft. For example:
  
      "What is the total revenue of Apple?"
      
      "How has net income changed for Tesla?"
      
      "Tell me about Microsoft's cash flow."
      
      Type exit to close the chatbot.

## Limitations

  The chatbot only responds to specific keywords and predefined query formats.
  
  It cannot interpret complex natural language or ambiguous queries.
  
  Financial data is static and limited to the three companies and three financial metrics.
  
  It is intended as a learning prototype, not a production-ready chatbot.
